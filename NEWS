Update History of ForeCA:
=========================

Version 0.0.6
--------------

- added many additional functions in the package, including the main algorithm `ForeCA.EM`
- changed to Roxygen2 documentation


Initial release version 0.0.1:
------------------------------

- base functions to estimate (spectral) entropies and Omega for (multivariate) time series
- first draft of documentation
- simple examples in help files

First version 0.0.1 written by Georg M. Goerg on May 14, 2012.

Bugs & feature requests:
========================
* check what is the best to store the 3D array spectrum (frequency last or first?)
* include other spectrum estimators
* include a continuous version estimator of entropy; e.g. used to compute entropy for a fitted AR spectrum
* compressed sensing type of sparsity in the spectrum; currently only by a heuristic thresholding rule
