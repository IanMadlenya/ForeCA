Changes to ForeCA:
==================

Update history on the ForeCA package.

Initial release 0.0.1:
- base functions to compute (spectral) entropies and Omega for (multivariate) time series
- first draft of documentation
- simple examples in the help files

First version 0.0.1 written by Georg M. Goerg on May 14, 2012.

Bugs & feature requests:
========================

* include other spectrum estimators
* include a continuous version estimator of entropy; e.g. used to compute entropy for a fitted AR spectrum
* compressed sensing type of sparsity in the spectrum; currently only by a heuristic thresholding rule
